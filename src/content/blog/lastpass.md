**Password maintenance post Heartbleed**

It's been a hard slog updating my passwords for everything post Heartbleed, but I'm finally done.
I'm not a regular user of [Lastpass](https://lastpass.com/), but the security check tool they have has been invaluable in finding all my weak passwords, a tool sorely lacking in my go-to password manager, keepass.
By the time I'd finished, I removed 32 entries for sites that have vanished from the internet.
