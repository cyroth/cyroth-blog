After far too much time putting up with Windows just to play games, I just had enough one day and thought I'd finally give gaming on Linux a go.

The Proton inegration with Steam is frankly pretty amazing and so far everything has been fine. I picked Arch partly due to Valve using it as a base for SteamOS and partly for the memes. That said, the archwiki is amazing and I think for a gaming desktop it's important to have updated drivers and software.  

KDE just because it works well and the builtin apps are good enough.  

Polychromatic and input-remapper are actually a pretty decent standin for Synapse. 

Onedrive and Google Drive both mounted with rclone at boot as documented [here](https://cyroth.dev/guides/linux/mount-cloud-drives/)

While I've got VScode installed, I've been using Neovim or Antigravity for most of my coding. I know it's basically just VSCode with a Google login but it's far less annoying than Copilot. (Despite some of the questionable autocomplete stuff that Gemini decides to do)
